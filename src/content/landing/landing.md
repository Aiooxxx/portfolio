Welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm Paul, a Software Engineer (Frontend) at [Reputation](https://reputation.com/) based out of Chicago, Illinois. I recently graduated from Indiana University with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science, with an interest in **Software Development**, **UX Design** and **Artificial Intelligence**!

My background in both **development** and **design** puts me in a great position to create bold experiences and **I strive to make the perfect user interface look good, and work even better** â€“ while keeping the user's needs at the center.

I enjoy talking, so get in touch!
